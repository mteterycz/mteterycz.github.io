Ada is a high-level programming language that was originally designed for systems programming and real-time applications. Here are five advantages (pluses) and five disadvantages (minuses) of using Ada:

### Pluses:
1. **Strong Typing**: Ada enforces strong typing, which helps catch errors at compile time rather than at runtime, leading to more reliable code.

2. **Readability and Maintainability**: The syntax of Ada is designed to be clear and readable, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain code over time.

3. **Concurrency Support**: Ada has built-in support for concurrent programming, allowing developers to easily create multi-threaded applications, which is essential for real-time systems.

4. **Safety and Reliability**: Ada is often used in critical systems (like aerospace and defense) due to its emphasis on safety and reliability, including features for exception handling and task management.

5. **Standardization**: Ada is standardized by ISO, which ensures consistency and portability across different platforms and compilers.

### Minuses:
1. **Steep Learning Curve**: The language can be complex for beginners, especially due to its extensive features and strict syntax rules.

2. **Limited Libraries and Tools**: Compared to more popular languages like Python or Java, Ada has fewer libraries and development tools, which can limit its usability in certain domains.

3. **Performance Overhead**: While Ada is designed for safety and reliability, some of its features (like strong typing and runtime checks) can introduce performance overhead compared to lower-level languages like C or C++.

4. **Niche Usage**: Ada is primarily used in specific industries (e.g., aerospace, military), which can limit job opportunities and community support compared to more widely-used languages.

5. **Verbosity**: Ada's syntax can be more verbose than other programming languages, which may lead to longer code and potentially slower development times for simple tasks. 

Overall, the choice to use Ada often depends on the specific requirements of the project and the domain in which it is being applied.
