Here are five advantages (pluses) and five disadvantages (minuses) of the C programming language:

### Pluses of C:
1. **Performance**: C is a low-level language that provides high performance and efficient memory management, making it suitable for system programming and applications requiring speed.

2. **Portability**: C code can be compiled and run on various platforms with minimal changes, making it highly portable across different systems.

3. **Rich Library Support**: C has a vast standard library that provides numerous built-in functions for handling tasks like string manipulation, mathematical computations, and file operations.

4. **Control Over System Resources**: C allows direct manipulation of hardware and memory through pointers, giving programmers fine-grained control over system resources.

5. **Foundation for Other Languages**: Many modern programming languages (like C++, C#, and Java) are influenced by C, making it a valuable language to learn for understanding programming concepts and paradigms.

### Minuses of C:
1. **Complex Syntax**: C has a relatively complex syntax compared to higher-level languages, which can make it harder for beginners to learn and understand.

2. **Manual Memory Management**: C requires programmers to manage memory manually, which can lead to memory leaks and segmentation faults if not handled properly.

3. **Lack of Object-Oriented Features**: C does not support object-oriented programming (OOP) natively, which can make it less suitable for large-scale software development compared to languages that do.

4. **Error Handling**: C's error handling is less robust than in some other languages, relying on return codes and manual checks, which can lead to less readable and maintainable code.

5. **Limited Standard Library**: While C has a rich standard library, it is not as extensive as those found in higher-level languages, which may require additional libraries for certain functionalities.

These points highlight the strengths and weaknesses of C, making it a powerful but sometimes challenging language to work with.
